                        <h2>Web design</h2>
                        <p>Web Design is the process of planning, creating, and maintaining websites. It involves a mix of visual design, user experience (UX), and technical development to make websites that are both functional and appealing.<br>Here’s a detailed overview of what web design includes, especially from a CSIT student perspective:<br><br><ul><li>Layout – Organizing content in a clear and accessible way (using CSS Grid, Flexbox, Bootstrap, etc.).</li><li>Color Scheme – Choosing colors that reflect the brand or topic while ensuring readability and visual harmony.</li><li>Responsiveness – Ensuring the site works well on all devices (phones, tablets, desktops).</li></ul></p>

                        <h2>UI/UX design</h2>
                        <p>UI/UX Design plays a vital role in creating effective and engaging digital experiences. UI (User Interface) focuses on the visual aspects of a product — such as layout, colors, typography, and interactive elements — ensuring that users can interact with a website or app in a visually pleasing and intuitive way. On the other hand, UX (User Experience) is about the overall feel and usability of the product, aiming to provide a seamless and meaningful experience to the user by understanding their needs, behavior, and expectations. Together, UI and UX design ensure that digital products are not only aesthetically attractive but also easy to use and navigate. As a CSIT student, learning UI/UX skills enhances your ability to design user-centered websites or applications that are both functional and appealing, making you stand out in the web development and software industry.</p>

                        <h2>App design</h2>
                        <p>App Design is a crucial aspect of developing successful mobile or desktop applications, combining both UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) principles to create intuitive, functional, and visually appealing apps. UI in app design deals with the visual layout of the app — including buttons, icons, color schemes, typography, and animations — ensuring that users can interact with the app smoothly. UX focuses on the overall journey of the user, aiming to provide a seamless, efficient, and satisfying experience by understanding user behavior and designing workflows that reduce friction. A well-designed app not only looks attractive but also guides users effortlessly through tasks, improving usability and engagement. For CSIT students, mastering app design helps bridge the gap between development and user needs, enabling the creation of applications that are both technically sound and user-friendly.</p>
